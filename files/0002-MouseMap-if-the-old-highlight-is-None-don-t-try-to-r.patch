Subject: [PATCH 2/2] MouseMap: if the old highlight is None, don't try to
 redraw

When pressing a button and moving out of the button area with the button held
down, we get two leave events - once when actually leaving the button and once
more when the button press is released later. On the second call, the old
highlight is already None, causing a crash when we're trying to get SVG
information about it.

Fixes #185
